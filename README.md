## Taks:Build an functional where use the pattern .
## Theory about the patterns:
### * The decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
### * The facade pattern  is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.
### * The adapter pattern is a software design pattern  that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
### * The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four. The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to separate responsibilities into different classes.
### 1. Decorator pattern for adding additional features to movies:
- Defines two classes that implement the Decorator pattern, which allows adding additional features to movie without modifying their underlying structure.
```
class MovieDecorator
```
```
class MovieWithGenre
```
